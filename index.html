    <p>
        I have come to this Develop course hoping to improve my programming skills and hopefully be able to get a job in the industry. I have worked in the retail and the legal sector before but I feel that this is an opportunity for me to get my foot on the ladder of a more permanent career.

        <a id = "link1">1.1 The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is, by now, a completely integrated way of working in mostly all current businesses. Before the days of IT data was all paper based and records had to be physically transferred from one place to another. IT allows us to digitally transfer data from place to place instantly and without delay, this means that IT can and has exponentially increased the efficiency with which businesses can operate. IT can also increase security in business with the use of encryption and passwords. Completely online, secure forms of payment and paperless business transactions are now possible.<a href = "#ref1">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is however an efficient and non-efficient way to integrate IT into a business. An efficient way is to integrate IT in such a way so either day to day or more involving tasks are quickened or eliminated from a work process by the inclusion of IT. An inefficient way to integrate IT would be to add extra tasks or extra dependencies on certain tasks to the way a business operates, thus increasing the amount of time tasks take and decreasing efficiency over all.<a href = "#ref2">[2]</a>

        1.2 Methods, Skills and Resources Needed to Complete Digital Projects Successfully
    </h2>
    <p>
        Workflow management applications such as Trello can help to organise tasks and compartmentalise them into smaller, structured chunks as well as scheduling tasks to be completed at certain times or by certain people. Trello is useful for using the Kanban method of project management in which tasks are organised into ‘to do’, ‘doing’ and ‘done’ sections.<a href = "#ref3">[3]</a> Slack is also a useful messaging tool for sharing code and files and can also be used for automating features from other apps.<a href = "#ref4">[4]</a>
    </p> 
    <p>
        When planning a digital project it is also important to delegate and organise tasks, It is also important to get the right people with the right skills for the job. These skills might be expertise in certain systems, programming languages or generalised areas of expertise. With the right people on the job the task will be completed in a relatively speedy manner. If working independently, it is important to organise tasks in terms of priority and dependencies so tasks can be completed in the right order.

        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website
    </h2>
    <p>
       To design my website I am using HTML and CSS. I will create the basic content of the website with HTML and then create a CSS file formatting the page. I will be using Trello to plan my project and organise my tasks.<a href = "#ref5">[5]</a>

    <h2>
        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Deadlines may be strict and not be met in time. This could be for reasons of poor management, poor organisation or because of unforeseen problems that halt the projected speed of the project. This could result in pulling the plug on a project if it is incredibly time critical.
    </p>
    <p>
        A project that loses its focus can be a problem and can result in not only slow progress but a less than optimal outcome. One of the problems that could occur in such case is feature creep. This is when, either a vagueness in the goals for the project or an over zealous workforce, results in the development of too many features for what is required for the project outcome. This results in the project taking far too much time and having too many, overcomplicated systems.<a href = "#ref6">[6]</a> Another problem is the opposite, this is where only the bare minimum is created for the project. This could result in an application which requires too much involvement by the end user and wastes too much time for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Security could be an issue. It is important that all software designed is tested for any leaks in security. If this is not done correctly software is at risk from attacks or hackers.<a href = "#ref7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lack of bug fixes or after support could also be an issue. Even after apps and software are tested and released there still may be bugs and it is important to have a facility to gather error reports and/or listen to user comments. Many apps and software also need updates regularly in order to keep up with current generations of OSs and devices. If these are not kept up with, software will become unsupported.<a href = "#ref8">[8]</a>
    </p>

    <h2>
        1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
    </h2>
    <p>
        If it is designing an app for example you have to decide whether it will be native or cross-platform and what kind of programming languages or applications would be best suited to develop that app. The Xcode development environment and Swift programming language could be used if developing for iOS for example.<a href = "#ref9">[9]</a> If developing for Android, Android Studio development environment and C++, Kotlin or Java programming languages could be used.<a href = "#ref10">[10]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If developing a cross platform app, you need a server to host your web based content. You then have to choose which languages to use to generate your content. You also need to ensure that the way you are working ensures that the app is compatible with multiple systems and have no native features.<a href = "#ref11">[11]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is a web application for example, you have to take into account what setup you want for your server and what languages you want to use for server/client side processes or whether it can be integrated into a larger framework.<a href = "#ref12">[12]</a> You might also want to decide what web hosting platform you might want to use such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure.<a href = "#ref13">[13]</a><a href = "#ref14">[14]</a>

    <h2>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
    </h2>
    <p>
        Trello can help me organise my workflow in terms of the Kanban method (as described in 1.2). Github can help me organise and store my files so they are readily accessible from other machines. I used HTML to construct the basic content of my website and CSS to format and style it.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="maindiv">
    <h2>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
    </h2>
    <p>
        The GDPR or General Data Protection Regulations are very important when designing software and apps. They ensure that sensitive and/or personal information cannot be traded or used unfairly or without consent. This ensures people’s privacy and holds companies liable for any breach of any rules. The new European Data Protection Regulations enforce that any website that uses cookies or stores user data of any kind has to warn and ask for permission before any data from the user is stored.<a href = "#ref15">[15]</a>

<div class="maindiv">
    <h2>
        2.1  Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
    </h2>
    <p>
        For my project I used Trello, Slack and VS Code. Trello is very useful as a Kanban board method workflow management app. As I have no other experience with other workflow management software however, I have no way to compare it with anything else. Trello has, nonetheless, allowed me to change my approach in the organising of tasks into manageable chunks. Slack was useful in communicating and trading helpful messages from colleagues, which allowed me to take on feedback and change my approach, even if this was a solo project. VS Code is a useful development environment, it allows for streamlined workflow as the syntax is detected by the file type. It also has an inbuilt terminal and debugger. The debugger was useful for running and checking code for mistakes without having to run the code in external programs. The terminal was useful for pushing to Github without having to use MacOS’s terminal, this saved time having to navigate to the correct file and setting up the MacOS terminal with git.

    <h2>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
    </h2>
    <p>
        The tools I chose were appropriate as they allowed me to complete my tasks effectively and made working more streamlined than, say, working only with a text editor and no messaging service.
