        <a>1.1 The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        IT is, by now, a completely integrated way of working in mostly all current businesses. Before the days of IT data was all paper based and records had to be physically transferred from one place to another. IT allows us to digitally transfer data from place to place instantly and without delay, this means that IT can and has exponentially increased the efficiency with which businesses can operate. IT can also increase security in business with the use of encryption and passwords. Completely online, secure forms of payment and paperless business transactions are now possible.<a href = "#ref1">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is however an efficient and non-efficient way to integrate IT into a business. An efficient way is to integrate IT in such a way so either day to day or more involving tasks are quickened or eliminated from a work process by the inclusion of IT. An inefficient way to integrate IT would be to add extra tasks or extra dependencies on certain tasks to the way a business operates, thus increasing the amount of time tasks take and decreasing efficiency over all.<a href = "#ref2">[2]</a>

        1.2 Methods, Skills and Resources Needed to Complete Digital Projects Successfully
    </h2>
    <p>
        Workflow management applications such as Trello can help to organise tasks and compartmentalise them into smaller, structured chunks as well as scheduling tasks to be completed at certain times or by certain people. Trello is useful for using the Kanban method of project management in which tasks are organised into ‘to do’, ‘doing’ and ‘done’ sections.<a href = "#ref3">[3]</a> Slack is also a useful messaging tool for sharing code and files and can also be used for automating features from other apps.<a href = "#ref4">[4]</a>
    </p> 
    <p>
        When planning a digital project it is also important to delegate and organise tasks, It is also important to get the right people with the right skills for the job. These skills might be expertise in certain systems, programming languages or generalised areas of expertise. With the right people on the job the task will be completed in a relatively speedy manner. If working independently, it is important to organise tasks in terms of priority and dependencies so tasks can be completed in the right order.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="maindiv">
    <h2>
        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website
    </h2>
    <p>
       To design my website I am using HTML and CSS. I will create the basic content of the website with HTML and then create a CSS file formatting the page. I will be using Trello to plan my project and organise my tasks.<a href = "#ref5">[5]</a>
    </p>

<div class=maindiv>
    <h2>
        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Deadlines may be strict and not be met in time. This could be for reasons of poor management, poor organisation or because of unforeseen problems that halt the projected speed of the project. This could result in pulling the plug on a project if it is incredibly time critical.
    </p>
    <p>
        A project that loses its focus can be a problem and can result in not only slow progress but a less than optimal outcome. One of the problems that could occur in such case is feature creep. This is when, either a vagueness in the goals for the project or an over zealous workforce, results in the development of too many features for what is required for the project outcome. This results in the project taking far too much time and having too many, overcomplicated systems.<a href = "#ref6">[6]</a> Another problem is the opposite, this is where only the bare minimum is created for the project. This could result in an application which requires too much involvement by the end user and wastes too much time for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Security could be an issue. It is important that all software designed is tested for any leaks in security. If this is not done correctly software is at risk from attacks or hackers.<a href = "#ref7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lack of bug fixes or after support could also be an issue. Even after apps and software are tested and released there still may be bugs and it is important to have a facility to gather error reports and/or listen to user comments. Many apps and software also need updates regularly in order to keep up with current generations of OSs and devices. If these are not kept up with, software will become unsupported.<a href = "#ref8">[8]</a>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="maindiv">
    <h2>
        1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
    </h2>
    <p>
        If it is designing an app for example you have to decide whether it will be native or cross-platform and what kind of programming languages or applications would be best suited to develop that app. The Xcode development environment and Swift programming language could be used if developing for iOS for example.<a href = "#ref9">[9]</a> If developing for Android, Android Studio development environment and C++, Kotlin or Java programming languages could be used.<a href = "#ref10">[10]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If developing a cross platform app, you need a server to host your web based content. You then have to choose which languages to use to generate your content. You also need to ensure that the way you are working ensures that the app is compatible with multiple systems and have no native features.<a href = "#ref11">[11]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is a web application for example, you have to take into account what setup you want for your server and what languages you want to use for server/client side processes or whether it can be integrated into a larger framework.<a href = "#ref12">[12]</a> You might also want to decide what web hosting platform you might want to use such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure.<a href = "#ref13">[13]</a><a href = "#ref14">[14]</a>

    <h2>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
    </h2>
    <p>
        Trello can help me organise my workflow in terms of the Kanban method (as described in 1.2). Github can help me organise and store my files so they are readily accessible from other machines. I used HTML to construct the basic content of my website and CSS to format and style it.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="maindiv">
    <h2>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
    </h2>
    <p>
        The GDPR or General Data Protection Regulations are very important when designing software and apps. They ensure that sensitive and/or personal information cannot be traded or used unfairly or without consent. This ensures people’s privacy and holds companies liable for any breach of any rules. The new European Data Protection Regulations enforce that any website that uses cookies or stores user data of any kind has to warn and ask for permission before any data from the user is stored.<a href = "#ref15">[15]</a>

        2.1  Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
    </h2>
    <p>
        For my project I used Trello, Slack and VS Code. Trello is very useful as a Kanban board method workflow management app. As I have no other experience with other workflow management software however, I have no way to compare it with anything else. Trello has, nonetheless, allowed me to change my approach in the organising of tasks into manageable chunks. Slack was useful in communicating and trading helpful messages from colleagues, which allowed me to take on feedback and change my approach, even if this was a solo project. VS Code is a useful development environment, it allows for streamlined workflow as the syntax is detected by the file type. It also has an inbuilt terminal and debugger. The debugger was useful for running and checking code for mistakes without having to run the code in external programs. The terminal was useful for pushing to Github without having to use MacOS’s terminal, this saved time having to navigate to the correct file and setting up the MacOS terminal with git.

    <h2>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
    </h2>
    <p>
        The tools I chose were appropriate as they allowed me to complete my tasks effectively and made working more streamlined than, say, working only with a text editor and no messaging service.

    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
        <p>
            Due to a lack of understanding of the particular way CSS works in coordination with HTML there was a lot of trial and error involved in the creation process of my blog. As a result things were not developed as quickly as I would have liked and I did not get to introduce features that I would have liked. Here are a list of strengths and weaknesses of my website taken from the perspective of a first time viewer:-
        </p>
        <h2>
            Strengths
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple layout, easy to understand.</li>
            <li>Jump-to links to navigate easily to references.</li>
            <li>Back-to-top links to navigate easily from any of the main headings to title bar.</li>
            <li>Pleasing blue colour on main title bar.</li>
            <li>Nice background image of Dovestones Reservoir.</li>
            <li>Tab bar and all divs slightly translucent so background image visible.</li>
            <li>Text visible against background through the use of contrasting colours and shadow effects.</li>
            <li>Titles and subtitles clearly delineated from one another by being different sizes.</li>
            <li>The whole page and all its content, including the menu and the background, scales to window size and does not distort or come out of place (unless the window is incredibly small).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Weaknesses
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Style and colours of website are very basic.</li>
            <li>No rollovers.</li>
            <li>The one page style appeals to me but may not appeal to all users.</li>
            <li>Only one font used for whole blog, although this creates a consistent style throughout (and was a conscious decision), the lack of other text styling leaves the page looking a bit bare.</li>
            <li>When clicking on the references, although the jump-to links work well, the references themselves are not highlighted.</li>
            <li>When clicking on the number for a reference in the reference section it does not take you back to the position in the text where the reference was.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
    </h2>
    <p>
        I would have liked to include jump-back to reference place in text links on the references. I also would have liked to include JavaScript and perhaps more complicated menu systems with rollovers and animations. I would also have liked to find more sophisticated ways to present  and format the look of divs, gradients or other more interesting ways to generate content with CSS and Javascript.

    <h2>
        2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
        For outcome 1 I have met the criteria as I have used a combination of Trello, Slack, VS Code, to programme and plan and produce content for my website. I have used CSS and HTML languages to layout the style and format of my website. Through the use of these tools I have proven that I can Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        For outcome 2 I have met the criteria because I have been adapting my use of the applications and languages mentioned in the paragraph above to create my blog. During the creation of my blog I have learned through the use of these applications and languages, how they work and operate and also how to use them more effectively. This of course is an ongoing process and I will continue to learn going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        For outcome 3 I have met the criteria because I have developed and tested solutions whilst creating my website. I have experimented with different solutions to problems and then through trial, error and research have come to an effective solution. An example of this would be finding a way to format the universal tab bar at the top of my website. It was not scaling correctly so I had to experiment with different methods and research how to correctly scale and centre divs using CSS and HTML.

        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency
    </h2>
    <h2>
        Trello
    </h2>
    <p>
        The benefits of trello are that you can easily format your tasks in terms of priority and both organise and update your workflow very easily. Another benefit is that you can easily work collaboratively by assigning tasks to people and giving different people permission to edit the board. A drawback is that it is always online and if an internet connection is lost then it is not possible to see the updated board or even to schedule updates for a later time. Another drawback is push notifications for phones work incredibly slowly so using your phone as a reminder for trello is not an option.
    </p>
    <h2>
        VS Code
    </h2>
    <p>
        The benefits of VS code are that it automatically detects the language you are using and adjusts its syntax detection accordingly. The autofill feature saves time by recommending objects, functions or variables you have used previously. You get tooltips on objects or variables you use the most useful for me was the colour picker tooltip in CSS. You can also push easily to Github with the inbuilt terminal. The inbuilt debugger allows you to run and debug code without having to go through external means. The drawbacks of VS Code is that certain extensions have to be downloaded in order to access features. This can also be a benefit though as it keeps the application size at a minimum and means that there are no superfluous processes being run.
    </p>
</div>
<div class= "maindiv">
    <h2>
        3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </h2>
    <p>
        If this project was not a solo project working in teams could have improved the efficiency and speed of working through planning and delegation of tasks via Trello. I could have researched earlier into how to implement certain features instead of experimenting straight away and wasting time getting it wrong.
    </p>
</div>
<div class= "maindiv">
    <h2>
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
    </h2>
    <p>
        If I were to do this project again and I was focusing on speed, I would use teamwork and collaborative tools for planning tasks. Again, I would use Trello and Slack to communicate and delegate tasks to work more efficiently. If I were focusing on personal development I would work solo again but become more efficient at the way I absorb information as stated in 3.2.
    </p>
</div>
<div class= "maindiv">
    <h2>
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h2>
    <p>
        Testing would be done by copying local file path of website to browser and then refreshing the page when updates are made to either the CSS or HTML document. Then the website should be tested in a de maximized state at different sized windows to see how responsive the site is to resizing. Then all the links should be tested to see if they work and jump-to links as well.

    <h2>
        1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have decided to go for one page with jump-links instead multiple pages with links to external pages. Each jump-link leads to the relevant main title of each section. Everything on the page is resizeable depending on the screen size, including the background. The main title is translucent blue with white writing and slight drop shadow. The main menu is a grey colour with borders on the left and right of each button with white writing with a slight drop shadow. The main div tags surrounding each question and answer paragraph(s) are white and slightly translucent with black writing. The fonts are all Arial.

        1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
    </h2>
    <p>
        Copyright law means that work under its protection cannot be copied, plagiarised, distorted or misused by any person or group of people without the original copyright holder’s consent. Work can be paraphrased or referenced but only as long as the original copyright holder is alluded to.<a href="ref16#">[16]</a><a href="#ref17">[17]</a> There is also Fair Use, this means that within reason an original copyrighted work can be used if it is sufficiently adjusted (as in artwork or image), commented upon (for the purpose of review or critique for example) or used for demonstration purposes (teaching, documentary etc) this counts as Fair Use.<a href="#ref18">[18]</a> There is also the concept of Copyleft which is where some of the rights of the property holder are waived deliberately to allow the property to be freely copied, shared and adapted provided that all subsequent iterations of the property are kept under the Copyleft protection.<a href="#ref19">[19]</a> All these things have to be taken into account when publishing a website. For this reason I have ensured that I have referenced all my sources and not plagiarised any content.

    <h2>
        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Blind people will not be able to access my website as there is no way for them to read the page. An audio helper would be a good addition to allow blind people to hear the content. Also the hard of sight may not be able to see the writing as the fonts are not resizeable. This could be improved by having a resizable font option from my website or possibly having two separate websites, one with regular sized and one with large sized font.

    <p>
        The appropriate file types for websites, and the most commonly used, are, for front end: CSS, HTML and JavaScript. HTML lays out the basic content of the page ie titles, paragraphs, layout of boxes and margins etc; CSS adds the visual styling and formatting to a page; Javascript can generate and manipulate HTML or CSS to generate parts of a page or gather information.
